You should create a rather rudimentary web shop. For the first step you get the following description from the customer:

Each product has a name and an article number. Furthermore it has one or more (graduated prices) prices and up to 5 pictures (urls). There are normal and digital products.

The normal products are sent by post and have only a certain stock. Digital products are not sent but provided digitally - they are therefore available without limit. When buying them, either a download link is generated or an e-mail is sent. Which of the two must be defined when creating the product.

Products can be added to the shopping cart as often as desired and can also be removed again. The individual contained products (name, article number, quantity, price for quantity) and the current total price can be displayed. In addition, the entire shopping cart can be purchased.

There are also categories. Categories always have a name and several products can be assigned to them. They also can be nested. It must be possible to display their hierarchy. Furthermore the products of a certain category can be displayed with name, article number, prices and pictures.

All users have a name, an address and can buy products. They also can subscribe to certain product events. A customer can be informed by mail when the price of a certain product has been updated, and sellers can be informed when a certain product has been sold and/or when the stock of a product is empty. A seller also can create products.


**Your Task**:

Convert the structure explained above in an object-oriented way into pseudo code or a programming language of your choice. Create corresponding interfaces and classes with the necessary member variables and function heads. Functions should not be implemented.
